  # If true, lines are indented using tab characters (utf-8

  # character, the behavior of the  fractional indentation is

  # If <use_tabchars> is True, then the value of this variable
  # indicates how fractional indentions are handled during
  # whitespace replacement. If set to 'use-space', fractional
  # indentation is left as spaces (utf-8 0x20). If set to
  # '`round-up` fractional indentation is replaced with a single'
  # tab character (utf-8 0x09) effectively shifting the column
  # to the next tabstop
